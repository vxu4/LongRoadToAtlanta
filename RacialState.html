          <p>&ldquo;There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States.&rdquo;
            <br />--U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, Plessy v. Ferguson 163 U.S. 537 (1896), excluding the Chinese from his vision of a &quot;color-blind&rdquo; constitution.
            <br />&ldquo;We have to really be vigilant with respect to the Muslim population&hellip;We have great Muslims. But we have to surveil; we have to create lists; we have the refugees coming in and we have to create lists.&rdquo; Donald Trump, presidential candidate, 2015
            <br />Donald Trump&#39;s resurrection of old libels accusing Asians of undermining the nation&#39;s health and security puts him late (but not last) in the long line of elected officeholders who have waved the red flag of xenophobia against Asian Americans over the past two centuries. Since colonial times, governing bodies, from the village meeting to the Federal government, have codified the social practices of &ldquo;race,&quot; defining its various meanings and memberships and distributing rights, privileges, obligations, and punishments accordingly, making &ldquo;race&rdquo; real, and part of an ordinary and unremarked way of life.
