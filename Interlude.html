      </h4>
      <p>
        <br />In the 19th Century, many states on the West Coast forbade Asians from testifying in courts or voting in local elections.&nbsp; State and local governments across the country passed laws prohibiting Asians from marrying whites and, in some cases, other people of color.&nbsp; State and local governments created taxes, fees, and regulations aimed at Asian businesses, and created segregated neighborhoods and schools for Asian children.&nbsp; Sixteen states passed laws prohibiting Asian immigrants, from purchasing or leasing farmland.
