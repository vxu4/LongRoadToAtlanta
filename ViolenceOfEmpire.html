          <p>“The Pacific must be preserved as an American Lake.”
            --President Dwight Eisenhower planning America’s war on Southeast Asia, 1954.
            
            Violence against Asians has been an ongoing feature of American history. We can’t understand the massacre of Korean massage workers in Atlanta unless we understand American violence in Asia. Before Asians arrived in  America, Americans came to the Pacific and Asia in search of goods and markets, souls to save, and bodies to exploit.   Since 1814, when American gunboats landed on Nuku Hiva in the Western Pacific, there has not been a twenty-year period in which Americans have not been at war somewhere in Asia.  From Hawaii to Syria, the US presence in the Pacific and across Asia is marked by war, colonial dispossession, occupations, garrisons, and client-states.
