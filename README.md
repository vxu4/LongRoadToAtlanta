Access these files on your local computer via one of the two methods: 
- Cloning https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
- Downloading https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives

These files are plain HTML, with CSS embedded within the <style></style> tags, and inline (e.g. <div style="...">). To see what one of these files looks like in your browser, navigate to the file and double click on the file. For any html files, it should pop up as a new tab in your default browser.
